#Getting recommendation from collaborative filtering and frequent pattern

This project datasets are from university assignment

##Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to optimize the placement of products within the store and
enhance the online shopping experience by providing personalized product recommendations. By
identifying frequent itemsets—groups of items often bought together—we can strategically place
these items to facilitate easy access for customers. Additionally, by employing recommendation
algorithms, we aim to suggest relevant products to customers based on their purchase history and
preferences.
